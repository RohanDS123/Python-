# Note - for loop is faster than while loop but we also use of while loop in python because while loop is use in advance condition checked .

num = int(input("Enter the number here:"))
i = 1
while(i<num):
    print(i)
    i+=1

# print the multiplication with the help of while loop in python programing language - 

number = int(input("Enter the any number here :"))
range = int(input("Enter the your range here: "))
i = 1
while(i<11):
    print(number,"X ",i,"= ",i*number)
    i+=1  # We can also do this  i = i + 1
print ("Done with the loop.")


# Countinue while loop - 
i = int(input("Enter the value of i here  :"))
while(i<38):
    i = int(input("Enter the value of i here :"))
    print(i)

    
# Decrementing while loop -  We can also  use of else with while loop
count = 5
while(count>0):
    print(count)
    count = count - 1
else:
    print("Thanks for using this program")

# How can we run the countinous for loop :
